# HackPVTA : The projects

Between Feb. 5 and 7, 2016, ninety students from the Five Colleges signed-up for our event! The goal was to work with PVTA data
and discover new insights about our favorite service. In this github repo, we are showcasing some of the 
projects that resulted from that work. 

## How to submit your work. 

**If you have a Github account**, then feel free to fork this repository, upload your work, and then submit a pull request.
You may also ask to be added to our Github organization via an e-mail at grid-officers@cns.umass.edu.

**If you don't have a Github account** or you have one but are not quite sure on how to carry-out the above project, feel free
to e-mail us your files (presentation, code, etc.) and we will take care of the rest.
